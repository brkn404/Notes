penetration testing checklist is an essential guide that helps ensure thorough coverage of security assessments. Here's a checklist broken down into various categories, with tools suggested for each section:
1. Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target systems. The goal is to collect as much information as possible without alerting the target.

    Gather Domain Information
        Tools: Whois, nslookup, DNSRecon, Sublist3r, theHarvester
    Gather Network Information
        Tools: Shodan, Censys, Netcraft, BinaryEdge
    Social Media Profiling
        Tools: Maltego, Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), Sherlock, OSINT Framework
    Public Data Leaks
        Tools: Google Dorks, Pastebin, GitHub search, LeakIX, Breach Compilation
    Company Information
        Tools: LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, Hunter.io

2. Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves interacting directly with the target to gather more detailed information. This might alert the target, so caution is needed.

    Port Scanning
        Tools: Nmap, Masscan, Zmap
    Service and Version Detection
        Tools: Nmap (with service detection), Netcat, Telnet, Nikto
    Vulnerability Scanning
        Tools: OpenVAS, Nessus, QualysGuard, Nexpose
    Web Application Enumeration
        Tools: Dirb, DirBuster, Gobuster, Nikto, Wfuzz
    Network Mapping
        Tools: Nmap (with NSE scripts), Maltego, Netdiscover

3. Exploitation

After gathering enough information, the next step is to exploit vulnerabilities.

    Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities
        Tools: Metasploit, Exploit-DB, searchsploit, Canvas, Core Impact
    Password Attacks
        Tools: Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat, Medusa
    Social Engineering
        Tools: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), Gophish, King Phisher
    Web Application Exploits
        Tools: SQLMap (SQL Injection), Burp Suite, ZAP, XSSer, XSStrike

4. Post-Exploitation

Once a system is compromised, the focus shifts to maintaining access and further exploitation.

    Privilege Escalation
        Tools: LinPEAS, WinPEAS, PowerUp, Sherlock (Windows), GTFOBins
    Persistence
        Tools: Metasploit (persistence modules), Empire, Cobalt Strike, Pupy
    Lateral Movement
        Tools: PsExec, CrackMapExec, Impacket, BloodHound (Active Directory)
    Data Exfiltration
        Tools: ExifTool, DNSCat2, Socat, PowerShell scripts

5. Reporting and Documentation

The final stage involves documenting the findings and providing a report with recommendations.

    Reporting
        Tools: Dradis, Serpico, Faraday, Metasploit Pro (for automated reporting)
    Documentation
        Tools: Markdown editors, CherryTree, Joplin, OneNote, Microsoft Word/Excel

6. Cleanup and Remediation

Post-assessment activities include cleaning up any artifacts left behind and providing remediation steps.

    Cleanup
        Tools: Manual removal (deleting user accounts, files), scripts to remove persistence mechanisms
    Remediation Advice
        Provide security patches, configuration changes, and policy updates.

7. Optional: Red Teaming Tools

For more advanced and simulated attack scenarios, red teaming tools can be used.

    Command and Control (C2) Frameworks
        Tools: Cobalt Strike, Empire, Covenant, Sliver
    Evasion Techniques
        Tools: Veil, Shellter, PowerShell Empire, Obfuscation frameworks

Final Notes:

    Legal and Ethical Considerations: Always ensure you have written permission before conducting penetration testing on any systems or networks.
    Tool Updates: Penetration testing tools should be regularly updated to ensure compatibility with the latest vulnerabilities and security measures.
    Skill Development: Knowledge of scripting, networking, and operating system internals is critical for effective penetration testing.
