Penetration Testing Comprehensive Guide
1. Pre-Engagement Phase
1.1. Define the Scope

    Objective: Identify the scope of the penetration test.
    Tasks:
        Identify the target systems, networks, and applications.
            Discuss with the client to understand which systems, applications, and networks will be in-scope.
            Use network diagrams and asset inventories to get an overview.
        Define the types of tests (black box, white box, gray box).
            Black Box: Tester has no prior knowledge.
            White Box: Tester has full knowledge (source code, credentials).
            Gray Box: Tester has partial knowledge.
        Confirm the testing boundaries with the client.
            Clarify what systems and areas are off-limits.
            Define acceptable downtime and the timing of tests to avoid disruptions.
        Obtain all necessary legal approvals and documentation.
            Prepare and sign NDAs, Rules of Engagement (RoE), and legal consents.

1.2. Prepare the Team

    Objective: Assemble a skilled penetration testing team.
    Tasks:
        Select team members with the required expertise.
            Ensure the team has specialists in network security, web application security, and any relevant areas (e.g., cloud security).
        Assign roles and responsibilities.
            Example roles: Team Leader, Network Analyst, Web Application Tester, Documentation Specialist.
        Prepare all tools and software required for the test.
            Ensure tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Wireshark are installed and updated.
        Ensure the team understands the scope and objectives.
            Conduct a briefing session to align everyone on the goals and scope.

1.3. Obtain Permissions

    Objective: Secure all legal and ethical permissions.
    Tasks:
        Obtain a signed NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).
            Ensure all parties involved understand and agree on confidentiality.
        Ensure there is a clear Rules of Engagement (RoE) document.
            Define the scope, limitations, and timeframes of the test.
        Get written consent from the organization to perform the test.
            This should include permission to attempt exploitation and document findings.

2. Information Gathering Phase
2.1. Passive Reconnaissance
